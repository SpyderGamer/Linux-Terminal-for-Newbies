# Extra Info â„¹
As my knowledge of Linux expands, I will make sure to keep this repo updated, so you won't miss anything. Linux has many capabilities, and the command line is just the beginning. Doing tasks with the command line makes things easier and much more efficient. But learning it takes time and patience. Good Luck!
